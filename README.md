# SemismoothQVIs

This repository implements the numerical examples found in:

(1) "A Globalized Inexact Semismooth Newton Method for Obstacle-type Quasi-variational Inequalities with Applications in Thermoforming", Amal Alphonse, Constantin Christof, Ioannis. P. A. Papadopoulos and Michael HintermÃ¼ller (2024).

## Installation
To install the package, try:

```julia
julia> ] add git@github.com:ioannisPApapadopoulos/SemismoothQVIs.jl.git
```

If that does not work try:

```julia
julia> ] add https://github.com/ioannisPApapadopoulos/SemismoothQVIs.jl.git
```

If that also does not work, contact John. 

Last resort: download the zip file, unzip, locate the folder and run

```julia
julia> ] 
pkg> activate /location to folder/SemismoothQVIs
  Activating project at `\location to folder\SemismoothQVIs.jl`
(SemismoothQVIs) pkg> initialize
```
If it says "Activating new project" then you are in the wrong folder.

Checkout the examples in the examples/ folder and have fun!
